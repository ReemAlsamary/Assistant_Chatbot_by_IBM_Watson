######**4. Create an Intent**
- The term "intent" refers to the user's motive or goal for submitting the question.
- Some intents, such as welcome are set automatically at Dialog, I'll also set up a couple custom intents.

#######**5. Create an Entity**
- Entities refers to particular bits of information present in a user question. Any significant data in the leading question, including as object kinds, dates/times, locations, and addresses, should be linked to entities. And we can develope new entities or use pre-built system entities as follows:

########**6. Dialog Nodes**
- Work with your Dialog for the chatbot to have a proper conversation, collect each intent with the entities it requires, as well as the responses.

- We can try the chatbot to make sure that the chatbot can communicate properly.
